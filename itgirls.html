                My name is Gracelyn Humphreys. I am going into my senior year (year 12).

                I decided to take this class because I'm interested in <strong>tech</strong>; I'm taking a computer engineering course and the computer science year starts this fall. I would like to learn about uses for technology from simple data to machine learning.

                I love to read, play soccer, throw discus (track and field), listen to music, and more. My favorite movies are Interstellar, The Breakfast Club, and 10 Things I Hate About You. My favorite books include Frankenstien, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Hunger Games, Sorcery of Throns, The Cruel Prince, and so, so many more.

                I have a younger brother who is fifteen and he would find it ironic that I'm writing this in HTML after helping him with his web design class this spring.

                I'm interested in Space, Engineering, Literature, Tech and Government. I just spent a week at Cornell's CURIE engineering program.
