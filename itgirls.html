                My name is Gracelyn Humphreys. I am going into my senior year (year 12).

                I decided to take this class because I'm interested in <strong>tech</strong>; I'm taking a computer engineering course and the computer science year starts this fall. I would like to learn about uses for technology from simple data to machine learning.

                I love to read, play soccer, throw discus (track and field), listen to music, and more. My favorite movies are:</p>

                <li>The Breakfast Club</li>
                <li>10 Things I Hate About You</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My favorite books include:</p>    
            <ul>
                <li>Frankenstein by Mary Shelley</li>

                I have a younger brother who is fifteen and he would find it ironic that I'm writing this in HTML after helping him with his web design class this spring.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm interested in Space, Engineering, Literature, Tech and Government. I just spent a week at Cornell's CURIE engineering program.
