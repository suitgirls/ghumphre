        <p>
            Genevieve Grotjan was a brilliant cryptanalyst who made a revolutionary discovery in September of 1940. Grotjan had applied for a civil service job and was hired by William Friedman to work in the Army’s Signal Intelligence Service (SIS). She was known as a quiet, methodical person and her major had been in mathematics. She worked on cracking “Purple”, a Japanese code system that had perplexed PhDs, Machines, and the western world. “Purple” was the successor to the cipher “Red,” and was much more complicated, as it was unlike anything the codebreakers had seen before.

            In September of 1940, as Grotjan was analyzing the data from “Purple,” she had a breakthrough that allowed the code to be cracked. She reportedly ran to Frank Rowlett, her supervisor, saying, “I’ve found it.” This breakthrough informed U.S. engineers on “Purple” enough to completely reconstruct the machine. Rowlett recognizes her breakthrough as the reason the project was successful. She had cracked the code no one else could - and she had done it by hand. The breakthrough helped to gain instrumental knowledge in both the Atlantic and Pacific during WWII.

            Not only was Grotjan’s work invaluable in WWII efforts, she also majorly contributed to Cold War efforts. In October of 1943, she was assigned to the Soviet Program and later worked on the project known as “Venona.” She designed a process for recognizing the re-use of keys. This process led to the decryption of Russian KGB messages and was said to be “the most important single cryptanalytic break in the history of Venona.”

            Additionally, she married Hyman Feinstein, a chemist at the National Bureau of Standards, in 1943. She worked as a research analyst for over seven years before eventually resigning from her government position on May 4, 1947. She later became a Mathematics Professor at George Mason University. In 2006, she died at the age of 93 after an extraordinary life of accomplishments. Her husband, Hyman Feinstein established a cryptology award in her honor within the Department of Mathematical Sciences at George Mason.

            For years, people didn’t know about her or her work for a few reasons. Her work was classified for decades after the war, so the public didn’t know about her contributions to cracking “Purple.” Additionally, women’s contributions to tech and science have long been erased or understated. Due to the classified nature of her work, she went on with her life after the war quietly, marrying and settling down; she never received national recognition for her work or wrote any sort of memoir, just continued on with her life.

            Ultimately, Genevieve Grotjan’s work was instrumental to the U.S. government in times of conflict and her genius still stands as inspiration today as to just what is possible. Not only is she inspiring many individuals, she stands out specifically as a brilliant and incredible woman for her time. She now inspires current women in STEM with her contributions; she’s a definite IT Girl.
